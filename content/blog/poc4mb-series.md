The **POC4MB** series is a recurring set of bite-sized jams with a simple goal:  
encourage experimentation without commitment.  

It’s not about a finished product.
It’s about tinkering, testing ideas for a rather low time investment.  

Because the best ideas are imperfect when tried.
Because 12 hours over a month feels approachable compared to full-scale jams.

# Rules

Only one rule:

{% class(class="box small-caps") %}
Content must be legal and kid-friendly.

Everything else is just a guideline.  
{% end %}

# Guidelines

## Duration

12 hours total, spread across a month.

Best done in short streaks of **1–2 hours** at a time.  

## Quality

Draft quality is expected (and encouraged).

## Participation

Hang out on the Discord to share:
	
- progress
- lack of progress
- random findings along the way

You might surprise yourself or inspire someone else.

# Call to action

Take a few hours during that POC4MB month, experiment, and share your thoughts.
