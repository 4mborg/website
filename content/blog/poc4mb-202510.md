The 1rst edition of the **POC4MB** is starting!

Duration: 1 month
Dates: October 1st â†’ October 31st, 2025

The spirit of POC4MB is simple:

* Experiment first. Donâ€™t worry about looks. Well, unless your experiment is about looks!
* Stay lightweight. Minimal overhead, maximum curiosity.
* Share openly. Show what worked, what didnâ€™t, and what could come next.

Whether youâ€™re tinkering with code, art, sound, hardware, or abstract systems, POC4MB is a space to try things out and compare notes with others doing the same.

# Rules

Only one rule:

{% class(class="box small-caps") %}
Content must be legal and kid-friendly.

Everything else is just a guideline.  
{% end %}

# Guidelines

## Duration

12 hours total, spread across a month.

Best done in short streaks of **1â€“2 hours** at a time.  

## Quality

Draft quality is expected (and encouraged).

## Participation

Hang out on the [4MB Jam Discord](https://discord.gg/ge3YuJheBY) to share:
	
- progress in `#progress`.
- screenshots in `#screenshots`.
- completed games in `#finished`. Ha. You didn't pay attention. This one was a trick.
- findings and strugglea in `#general`

# Resources

Any game engine can be used, but with a preference on non bloated desktop ones in the spirit of the 4MB Jam.

My personal preference is [PGETinker](https://pgetinker.com/). In fact I created the whole event to give myself an excuse to try it.
And yes, I know it is not Desktop, nor fitting 4MB. ðŸ˜‰

Others are [Tic80](https://tic80.com/), [pyxel](https://www.pyxelstudio.net/), [8bit workshop IDE](https://8bitworkshop.com/redir.html?) or anything you like. Show us your favorite engine!
