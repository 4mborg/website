# 4MB Game Jam Website

Greetings, this is the repo for the main website and blog. It uses Zola
and custom scripts for development and deployment.

Scripts located in the ``scripts`` directory are written with the assumption
they will be fun from the root directory.

For example, to deploy the development server, you would run the following
command from the root directory of the repositoty.

```bash
user@host:website$ scripts/run-dev-server.sh
```
